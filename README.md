        <h1>Black Hydra</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm <span class="highlight">Amir</span>, also known as <span class="highlight">Black Hydra</span>. Since childhood, I've been passionate about electronics and have been tinkering with electronic components since I was 5. For several years, I've been working professionally in this field, tackling various projects in reverse engineering, designing industrial and electronic boards, and creating hacking and security gadgets.</p>

        <p>My experience and expertise include working with languages like <span class="highlight">C, C++, MicroPython, Arduino, Ducky Script,</span> and <span class="highlight">Pine Script</span>. I'm also deeply interested in fields like <span class="highlight">Robotics, IT, IoT,</span> and <span class="highlight">AI</span> (currently learning machine learning) and I'm constantly striving to learn and grow in these areas.</p>

        <p>Additionally, <span class="highlight">PCB design</span>, hardware and software repair of mobile phones, laptops, and gadgets are among my skills. I'm also focused on security and networking, currently studying courses like <span class="highlight">CS50</span>. I'm always seeking new challenges and projects and hope to inspire others with my work!</p>
